# Entropy Playground, a game about evolution...
Open the html file in your browser, to my knowledge it doesn't matter which but at least I tested on Chrome and Firefox.

At the top left you'll see a real-time counter of your population, along with a large number of informations
   like averages, death counts and strongest lineage.
At the top right, a graph button, which will show you the evolution of the population in real time as well
   as the evolution of total deaths.
At the botton left, sliders to change different settings.

Settings:
   Mutation : How much a child can differ from its parent.
 Metabolism : Think of it as the specimen's life expectency,
                it's a number which will be used as a factor multiplied with the specimen's size
                to calculate its energy capacity and requirements for reproduction.
Energy Gain : The amount of energy gained by a specimen when eating another one.
                (linked with Metabolism through the size of the specimen which is eaten)
      Decay : How much the specimen's size decreases per frame until it dies.
